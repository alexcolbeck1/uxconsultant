## Overview

Sky Sports needed to align their iOS and Android apps with a major brand refresh and introduce new flagship features—on a tight deadline. The goal was to increase content consumption, improve logged-in usage, and maintain strong app store ratings.

## What I Did

- Led discovery research (surveys, app store reviews, Twitter analysis)
- Facilitated cross-functional ideation workshops
- Defined user journeys, information architecture, and key UX patterns
- Created prototypes using Axure, Sketch, and InVision
- Planned and ran usability testing (lab + unmoderated studies)
- Iterated designs based on user feedback and analytics

## The Problem

The existing app didn't reflect the new Sky Sports brand or content structure. Users struggled to filter the overwhelming volume of content, and live content—one of the most valuable features—was hard to access quickly. Differences between iOS and Android design patterns also needed to be respected to maintain familiarity.

## The Approach

Working within an Agile squad, I led research to understand user needs, mapped journeys for new features, and facilitated workshops to align the team around priorities. I created platform-specific prototypes and validated them through lab research and remote testing. We refined designs iteratively until usability issues were resolved.

## The designs

{{ captionedImage({

  alt: "Detailed description for screen readers",
  caption: "Brief explanation of what to conclude from the image."
}) }}

## Outcomes

The final experience made live content easier to find, allowed for user customisation, and improved content relevance. The enhanced live timeline and simplified navigation improved discovery and engagement.

## Results

- **+12% pageviews per visit**
- **+8% logged-in users**
- **+5 minutes** average increase in live content viewing sessions
