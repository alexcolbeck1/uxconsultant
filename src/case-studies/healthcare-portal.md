## Challenge

HealthTech Solutions needed a patient portal that would serve diverse users, including elderly patients with varying technical abilities and users with disabilities.

## Research

Research included:
- Interviews with 20 patients (ages 22-78)
- 8 sessions with patients using assistive technology
- Consultation with healthcare providers
- Analysis of existing portal pain points

### Key Insights

- Many users were accessing the portal on mobile devices
- Medication names and medical terminology were confusing
- Users needed reminders and notifications
- Privacy and security concerns were paramount

## Solution

Created a patient-centered portal with:

### Accessible Design
- High color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Scalable text (up to 200% without loss of functionality)
- Clear focus indicators
- Alternative text for all images

### Key Features
- Dashboard with upcoming appointments and tasks
- Medication list with plain-language descriptions
- Secure messaging with providers
- Document upload with accessibility-tagged PDFs

### Mobile-First Approach
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Simplified navigation for small screens

## Process

1. Created user personas and journey maps
2. Developed wireframes and conducted card sorting
3. Built high-fidelity prototypes
4. Tested with diverse user groups including assistive technology users
5. Iterated based on feedback

## Results

Post-launch metrics:
- **92% user satisfaction** score
- **WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance** achieved
- **45% increase** in patient engagement
- **30% reduction** in support calls

The portal received recognition from the American Medical Association for accessibility excellence.

## Impact

This project demonstrated that designing for accessibility doesn't mean compromising on aesthetics or functionality—it creates better experiences for everyone.
