## Overview

Sky needed to transform a low-traffic weather page into a useful interactive planning tool. The aim was to improve user engagement and provide forecast data in a way that supported real-world decisions.

## What I Did

- Designed and ran a mixed-method survey (3,000 responses in 48 hours)
- Conducted competitor pattern analysis
- Identified issues with proposed colour scales
- Ran guerilla research to validate new temperature colour choices
- Created wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes
- Conducted multiple rounds of usability testing
- Supported Agile development throughout delivery

## The Problem

Existing designs used colour scales that misled users about temperature at a glance. The layout and information hierarchy didn't support fast planning or comparison.

## The Approach

I used survey insights to identify which forecast elements were most valuable. I redesigned the interface to follow familiar weather conventions (iconography, colour consistency) and validated colour changes through quick public testing. Multiple design iterations were tested in Sky's research lab to refine clarity and usability.

## Outcomes

The tool became significantly more useful for daily and weekly planning. The final MVP improved both traffic and returning visitor rates.

## Results

- **+23%** visits to the weather section
- **+34%** returning users
