## Background

TechCorp had 8 different products with inconsistent design patterns, creating confusion for users and inefficiency for designers and developers.

## Objectives

1. Create unified visual language across products
2. Ensure accessibility baked into every component
3. Improve design-to-development workflow
4. Enable teams to build faster with less inconsistency

## Discovery

Research and audit phase:

- Audited all 8 products for patterns and components
- Interviewed 15 designers and developers
- Analyzed user feedback about inconsistencies
- Reviewed existing accessibility issues
- Documented current pain points

### Findings

- 23 different button variations across products
- No consistent approach to color or typography
- Accessibility issues throughout
- No shared component library
- Each team rebuilding common patterns

## Design System Components

### Foundation

- Color palette with accessible contrast ratios
- Typography scale optimized for readability
- Spacing system based on 8px grid
- Iconography with consistent style

### Components

Built 40+ components including:

- Buttons, forms, and inputs
- Navigation patterns
- Modal dialogs and alerts
- Data tables
- Cards and layouts

### Accessibility Standards

Every component includes:

- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimization
- Focus management
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion alternatives

### Documentation

- Usage guidelines for each component
- Accessibility considerations
- Code examples (React, Vue, Angular)
- Do's and don'ts
- Interactive playground

## Implementation Strategy

### Pilot Phase

- Selected 2 products for initial rollout
- Worked closely with teams during adoption
- Gathered feedback and iterated

### Rollout

- Created migration guides
- Held workshops for design and dev teams
- Provided ongoing support
- Established governance model

### Maintenance

- Monthly design system meetings
- Contribution process for new components
- Regular accessibility audits
- Version control and changelog

## Results

After 12 months:

- **70% reduction** in design-to-development time
- **All components WCAG 2.1 AA compliant**
- **95% adoption** across products
- **Consistent experience** across entire product suite
- Established as model for other companies

## Developer Impact

- Faster feature development
- Fewer accessibility bugs
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier onboarding for new team members

## User Impact

- More consistent, predictable experiences
- Better accessibility across all products
- Improved trust in the brand
- Reduced learning curve when using multiple products

## Reflections

Building a design system is as much about people and process as it is about components. Success required buy-in from leadership, patience during adoption, and continuous iteration based on real-world usage.
