## Challenge

WanderWays' booking platform had a complex, multi-step flow that confused users and had significant accessibility barriers preventing some users from completing bookings.

## Research Phase

Research included:

- 20 user interviews with travelers
- 5 accessibility-focused testing sessions
- Analysis of drop-off points in booking flow
- Competitive analysis of major travel sites
- Card sorting for information architecture

### Discovery

Key issues identified:

- Too many steps (8 total) in booking process
- Unclear pricing until final step
- Date picker not keyboard accessible
- Missing alt text on destination images
- Confusing error messages
- No way to save progress

## Design Approach

### Simplified Flow

Reduced from 8 steps to 4:

1. Destination and dates
2. Accommodation selection
3. Travel details
4. Payment and confirmation

### Progressive Disclosure

- Show relevant information at each step
- Display running total throughout
- Allow users to edit previous steps easily

### Accessibility Improvements

- Fully accessible date picker
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Screen reader announcements for updates
- Alternative text for all imagery
- Clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content

### Visual Design

- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Consistent component patterns
- Support for reduced motion preferences

## Implementation

- Created comprehensive design system
- Built interactive prototypes for testing
- Collaborated closely with development team
- Conducted accessibility audits at each milestone

## Testing & Validation

- 6 rounds of usability testing (35 total participants)
- Testing with screen reader users
- Testing with users with cognitive disabilities
- Mobile device testing across platforms
- Performance testing

## Impact

Post-launch results:

- **42% increase** in completed bookings
- **28% higher** average order value
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliant** throughout
- **90% user satisfaction** score
- Booking time reduced from 12 to 7 minutes average

Customer feedback particularly praised the clarity of the process and ability to complete bookings using only keyboard.

## Lessons Learned

Simplifying complex flows requires understanding not just what users do, but why. The accessibility improvements benefited all users, not just those using assistive technology.
