## Challenge

RetailCo was experiencing high cart abandonment rates (68%) during checkout. Users reported frustration with the lengthy process and unclear error messages.

## Research

I conducted:
- 15 user interviews with recent customers
- Heatmap analysis of checkout pages
- Competitive analysis of 5 leading e-commerce sites
- Accessibility audit revealing WCAG 2.1 AA violations

### Key Findings

- Users abandoned after seeing unexpected shipping costs
- Form validation errors were unclear and unhelpful
- Mobile experience was particularly problematic
- Screen reader users couldn't complete checkout

## Solution

Designed a streamlined 3-step checkout with:

1. **Clear Progress Indication**: Visual stepper showing current position
2. **Inline Validation**: Real-time, helpful error messages
3. **Cost Transparency**: Shipping calculator on cart page
4. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader tested

## Implementation

- Created interactive prototypes in Figma
- Conducted 3 rounds of usability testing
- Worked with development team on implementation
- A/B tested new design against existing checkout

## Results

After launch:
- **25% reduction** in cart abandonment
- **18% increase** in conversion rate
- **100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**
- Average checkout time reduced from 4.2 to 2.8 minutes

## Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of early user testing and the business value of accessibility. Making the checkout work for screen reader users improved the experience for everyone.
