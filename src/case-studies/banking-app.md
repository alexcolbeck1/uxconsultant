## Background

Community Bank's mobile app had a 2.3-star rating with complaints about confusing navigation, poor accessibility, and dated design.

## Discovery Phase

Comprehensive research including:
- App store review analysis (500+ reviews)
- 12 in-depth user interviews
- Usability testing of current app
- Accessibility audit
- Competitive analysis

### Problems Identified

- Navigation structure didn't match user mental models
- Critical features buried in menus
- Insufficient visual hierarchy
- No support for screen readers or voice control
- Biometric login available but difficult to set up

## Design Process

### Information Architecture
Restructured navigation based on user needs:
- Quick actions on home screen
- Grouped related features
- Reduced menu depth from 4 to 2 levels

### Visual Design
- Improved contrast and legibility
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent component library
- Support for light/dark modes

### Accessibility Features
- Voice Over and TalkBack support
- Dynamic type support
- Reduced motion option
- Clear focus states
- Descriptive labels for all interactive elements

### Security & Trust
- Clear security indicators
- Biometric authentication with easy setup
- Transaction confirmations with accessible summaries

## Testing & Iteration

- 4 rounds of usability testing (30 participants total)
- Accessibility testing with 6 assistive technology users
- Beta program with 500 customers
- Continuous refinement based on feedback

## Outcomes

After 6 months:
- App rating increased to **4.6 stars**
- **60% increase** in mobile banking adoption
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliant**
- Support tickets reduced by **40%**
- Featured in App Store "Apps We Love"

Customer feedback highlighted the improved ease of use and appreciation for accessibility features.

## Reflection

This project showed how combining user research, accessibility best practices, and iterative testing creates products that truly serve users' needs while building trust.
