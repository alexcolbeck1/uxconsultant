## Overview

NHS Notify is a national messaging platform that enables NHS organisations to send NHS App messages, emails, text messages, and letters to patients and the public. The service provides a centralised, cost-effective solution for patient communications across multiple channels.

## What I Did

As senior interaction designer, I led the interaction design for the entire programme:

- Designed the public-facing website explaining the service and its features
- Led interaction design for the logged-in account area used by NHS organisations
- Created user flows for template creation and management
- Designed the routing plans interface for message delivery logic
- Developed dashboard and reporting interfaces for message tracking
- Ensured consistency across multiple message channels (NHS App, email, SMS, letters)
- Collaborated with service designers, developers, and stakeholders across NHS England
- Conducted design critiques and iterated based on user research findings

## The Problem

NHS organisations were using disparate, costly systems to communicate with patients. There was no standardised, efficient way to send messages across multiple channels, leading to:

- High procurement and operational costs for individual trusts
- Inconsistent patient communication experiences
- Complex integration requirements for different messaging services
- Difficulty tracking message delivery and performance
- No unified way to reach patients through their preferred channels

## The Approach

Working within a large multidisciplinary team, I designed an intuitive platform that simplified complex message routing logic while remaining powerful enough for NHS organisations' needs.

### Public Website

Created a clear information architecture explaining:
- Service benefits and features
- How each message channel works
- Pricing transparency
- Getting started process

### Account Area

Designed key user journeys for:
- Creating and managing reusable message templates
- Setting up routing plans to determine message delivery logic
- Sending messages using NHS numbers as the single identifier
- Tracking message performance and delivery status
- Managing team members and permissions

### Multi-channel Design

Ensured consistent patterns across:
- NHS App messages and notifications
- Email templates
- Text messages (SMS)
- Letter formats including accessible formats

## Outcomes

NHS Notify provides NHS organisations with a cost-effective, centralised messaging solution that improves operational efficiency and enables better patient communication.

The platform's design makes complex routing logic manageable while maintaining the flexibility NHS organisations need for diverse messaging scenarios.

## Results

- **Free** NHS App messages and emails (unlimited)
- **70% cost reduction** on letters compared to traditional methods
- **Competitive SMS pricing** at 2.33p per message
- **No setup fees** or monthly charges
- Supports **NHS England organisations** and direct care services
- **Single identifier** (NHS number) simplifies message sending
- **Multi-channel routing** enables messages to reach patients through preferred methods

## Impact

By leading the interaction design, I helped create a platform that:

- Reduces procurement complexity for NHS organisations
- Lowers messaging costs across the NHS
- Enables the NHS digital-first strategy with NHS App prioritisation
- Provides accessible communication options for all patients
- Centralises message tracking and performance monitoring
