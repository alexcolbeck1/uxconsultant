## Overview

The NHS needed to increase the number of young people getting tested for chlamydia. Users were not finding relevant information, didn't understand it, and were unaware of available services or whether they were eligible.

## What I Did

- Provided interaction design within a GOV-style multidisciplinary team
- Transformed content and IA for chlamydia-related pages
- Created Axure and HTML prototypes
- Ran journey mapping workshops
- Collaborated closely with content designers and user researchers
- Conducted popup research, lab sessions, and accessibility testing

## The Problem

Users struggled to find essential information, and when they did, they didn't understand the tone or content. The existing digital experience was fragmented, unclear, and often patronising. Many users didn't know what services existed or whether they qualified.

## The Approach

I mapped the full end-to-end journey and co-designed two major improvements: clearer, actionable conditions content and a tool that directs users to the most appropriate local testing service. Content was rewritten to be concise, gender-neutral, and inclusive. Multiple rounds of research ensured usability, accessibility, and inclusivity for users with diverse needs.

## Outcomes

Users found clearer information, could identify the right service for their needs, and were more likely to choose NHS-preferred testing methods.

## Results

- **+33%** users who felt they found all the information they needed
- **+18%** chose the NHS-preferred sexual health professional route
- **–9.5%** reduction in users choosing GPs (least preferred option)
- **+67%** users who found a suitable service
- **From 2% to 28%** of "at-risk" users continued to the testing tool
