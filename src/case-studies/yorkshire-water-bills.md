## Overview

Yorkshire Water needed a digital solution to reduce bill-related enquiries and help customers understand their water bills independently. The goal was to create a simple, convenient experience that improved regulator scoring while reducing contact centre demand.

## What I Did

- Conducted desk research, customer interviews, and call-listening
- Facilitated a stakeholder discovery workshop
- Created Axure prototypes for both initial and revised concepts
- Designed user journeys and simplified bill explanation content
- Worked closely with copywriters, billing teams, and developers
- Ran moderated and remote usability testing

## The Problem

Water bills are complex and full of industry jargon. Customers had little visibility into why charges changed and often contacted support for basic questions. Early prototypes revealed that hotspot-based interactions were unclear and overwhelming.

## The Approach

I redesigned the experience as a step-by-step walkthrough using the customer's actual billing data. The content was rewritten in plain English, and a new API powered personalised explanations for payment changes. Iterative testing ensured the walkthrough was simple, intuitive, and jargon-free.

## Outcomes

Customers better understood their bills, could self-serve for common queries, and preferred the digital walkthrough over the paper bill.

## Results

- Significant reduction in confusion during usability sessions
- All participants preferred the walkthrough to the paper bill
- Majority of basic queries resolved without needing human support
