    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>I'm a UX and interaction designer focused on creating accessible, user-centered digital experiences. With a passion for understanding user needs and translating them into elegant design solutions, I help organizations create products that truly serve their users.</p>
      
      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>I believe in a human-centered design process that puts users at the heart of every decision. Through research, testing, and iteration, I work to understand the real problems people face and design solutions that are both effective and delightful to use.</p>
      
      <h2>Accessibility First</h2>
      <p>Accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's fundamental to good design. I ensure every project meets WCAG standards and is usable by people of all abilities, because great design should be inclusive design.</p>
